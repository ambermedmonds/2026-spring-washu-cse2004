        </aside>

        <section>
            <p>In my UX Research Methods for Design course, I led a full UX research and strategy process focused on improving how WashU students discover and join campus organizations, while also making it easier for club leaders to recruit, onboard, and engage new members. I translated research insights into a prototype designed to centralize club information, personalize discovery, and streamline onboarding for both students and club leadership.</p>

            <h2 class="header">The Challenge</h2>
        </aside>

        <section>
            <p>Club discovery at WashU is fragmented across word-of-mouth, social media, flyers, and an existing platform (<a href="https://wustl.presence.io/" target="blank">WUGO</a>). Information is often outdated or incomplete, making it difficult for students to compare options, understand expectations, or take the next step. Meanwhile, club leaders struggle with engaging new members as well as time-consuming onboarding and administrative workflows.</p>

            <h2 class="header">The Goal</h2>
        </aside>

        <section>
            <p>Understand the challenges WashU students face in finding and joining student organizations, as well as the difficulties club leaders encounter in recruiting and onboarding new members. Then, identify key pain points and explore opportunities to improve both club discovery and member engagement.</p>

        <section>
            <p>I followed an end-to-end user-centered process to uncover root problems and validate a solution direction:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Survey research to map patterns and scale pain points</li>
                <li>Interviews to understand motivations, behaviors, and real decision-making</li>
                <li>Secondary research to benchmark how other tools support student organization discovery</li>
                <li>Affinity mapping + theme clustering to synthesize insights</li>
                <li>Persona creation to capture key user types (students + club leaders)</li>
                <li>Journey mapping to locate pain points across discovery, decision-making, and onboarding</li>
                <li>Prototyping to explore an end-to-end solution concept</li>
                <li>Usability testing to refine navigation and information hierarchy</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="header">Key Findings</h2>
        </aside>

        <section>
            <p>Actionable insights:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Centralization: Students need a single, reliable source with up-to-date club info</li>
                <li>Personalization: Discovery improves with search, filters, and recommendations tied to interests (and ideally commitment level)</li>
                <li>Student Profile: Students want a “home base” to save clubs, track involvement, and express interests for better matching</li>
                <li>Club Profiles: Clubs need standardized, complete pages (mission, events, photos, contact info, social links, expectations, and clear “how to join” steps)</li>
            </ul>
